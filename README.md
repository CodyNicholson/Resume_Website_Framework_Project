# Resume Website Framework Project
This is the framework for my resume website. I made it to refer to friends so they can look good at their interviews.

To use this framework to create your resume website, follow these steps:

1. Download the project to your computer, then open the **index.html** file with your browser to check that the project is working
2. Put all of your information into the **resumeBuilder.js** file in the **js** folder. You can add as many work experiences, projects, educations, honors and awards, and community service sections as you like by separating each block by a comma the same way it is done throughout the file.
3. Change the pictures by putting your pictures in the images folder, and then referencing them in the **resumeBuilder.js** file the same way it is done throughout the file
4. Replace the **resume.pdf** placeholder with your resume that is also named **resume.pdf**
5. Once you are satisfied with your resume website, create a github account and click "Create New Repository". Name the repository "Resume_Project" or something. Drag and drop the contents of your resume project folder into the repository and press commit. Make sure the files are all in the repository, and that the index.html file is in the root folder.
6. Click "Settings" on github in your resume project repository and scroll down to **Github Pages**. Select **master branch** as your source and click **Save**. Wait a minute or two for the site to be published, and then click the link to see your new site.

Note: If you want to modify your site after this, you should learn how to use git to clone the project, modify the code, stage the changes, commit the changes, and push the changes to the repository on github.
